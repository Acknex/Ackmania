[erste Bewegung]
Lotter starts moving

[Himmel gesehen]
The sky shines bright in a rainbow of colors... he doesn't stop to wonder why

[fällt in Stacheln]
...and then he falls to his death

[fällt in Wasser]

[fällt in Lava]

[fällt in Feuer]

[musical]
and now to something completely different

[Jetpack]
